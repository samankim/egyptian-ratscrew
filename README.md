# egyptian-ratscrew

This project was created in the class CS106A (Programming Methodology) at Stanford and uses the acm.graphics packages. The program is based on the card game Egyptian Ratscrew and allows 2-4 players to play the game against each other or computer players.

I won the Peopleâ€™s Choice Award in the contest!
